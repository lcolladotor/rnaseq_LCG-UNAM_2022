## Code of Conduct {-}

We'll follow the CDSB code of conduct [comunidadbioinfo.github.io/codigo-de-conducta/](https://comunidadbioinfo.github.io/codigo-de-conducta/) as well as version 1.0.1 of the Bioconductor code of conduct [bioconductor.org/about/code-of-conduct/](http://bioconductor.org/about/code-of-conduct/). 

For reporting any violations of the code of conduct, report them to the Instructor and/or Course Coordinators.

## Course Prerequisites {-}

Install R 4.0.x from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) then install the following R packages:

```{r install, eval = FALSE}
## For installing Bioconductor packages
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) {
      install.packages("BiocManager")
  }

## Install required packages
BiocManager::install(
    c(
        "usethis", ## Utilities
        "here",
        "biocthis",
        "postcards",
        "pryr",
        "sessioninfo",

        "SummarizedExperiment", ## Main containers / vis
        "iSEE",

        "edgeR", ## RNA-seq
        "ExploreModelMatrix",
        "limma",
        "recount3",

        "pheatmap", ## Visualization
        "ggplot2",
        "patchwork",
        "RColorBrewer",

        "spatialLIBD" ## Advanced
    )
)
```

You will also need to install [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) version 1.4 or newer.

## Course Evaluation {-}

* Participation
  - (main evidence) written and/or verbal participation during sessions and break-out rooms
  - (optional, strongly encouraged for your own career) Community building: CDSB Slack (introduce yourself), twitter, GitHub, etc.
* Public work
  - (main evidence) Taking notes on GitHub
  - (optional) Deploy an iSEE `shiny` app on shinyapps.io
  - (advanced and optional) R package with notes following `usethis::create_package()` + `biocthis::use_bioc_pkg_templates()`.
* Final project
  - (main evidence) code in a public URL (gist, GitHub, ...)
  - (optional) a rendered Rmd file (RPubs, GitHub)
  - (optional advanced) Copy this repository, remove all the Rmds except the index.Rmd and edit accordingly. GitHub Actions will then help you render it. You'll need to fetch the `gh-pages` branch and at least make one commit for the HTML to be available such as this [commit](https://github.com/lcolladotor/rnaseq_LCG-UNAM_2021/commit/e15bd6c234dd0ca4233050a4a0a42184994fef3b).
  
The final grade will be a weighted average from the student's self evaluation (10%), the evaluation by each TA (15% each), your participation as evaluated by the instructor (10%), your public work (20%) and your final project (30%).

Projects, public work and notes are due at 9 am US Eastern on Monday March 1st, though we recommend doing any work related to this course by Friday February 26th.
